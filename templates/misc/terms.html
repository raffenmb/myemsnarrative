			</div>
			<div class="terms-header">
				NO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE
			</div>
			<div class="terms-text">
				As a condition of your use of the My Narrative Web Site, you warrant to My Narrative that you will not use the My Narrative Web Site for any purpose that is unlawful or that is prohibited by these terms, conditions My Narrative and notices.

				You may not disclose My Narrative Web Site Credentials to any third party (i.e., to anyone other than My Narrative and you).

				You may not enter into the My Narrative Web Site individually identifiable health information (as that phrase is defined in 45 CFR § 160.103).

In other words, while the very purpose of the My Narrative Web Site is to assist you in crafting a description of an event or series of events, such crafted descriptions must not include identifiable information related to the “who” or the “where” the event(s) occurred. Rather, the “who” and the “where” should be described using general characteristics that may be shared by many people or locations, respectively, such that inadvertent review or disclosure of such descriptions would not reveal the identity of a person whose physical or mental health may have been analyzed or otherwise involved in the event(s).
