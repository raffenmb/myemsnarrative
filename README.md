### About The Project

This project is the source code for the website <a href="https://www.myemsnarrative.com">www.myemsnarrative.com</a>. 

This website was created to help EMS providers write custom narratives for their patient care reports. Users are given pre-written narrative templates and phrase templates to construct narratives from. Users are able to edit and save these templates, as well as create their own, in order to write narratives faster while on the job.
