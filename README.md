### About The Project

This project is the source code for the website <a href="https://www.myemsnarrative.com">www.myemsnarrative.com</a>. 

This website was created to help EMS providers write custom narratives for their patient care reports. Users are given pre-written narrative templates and phrase templates to construct a narrative fast. Users also have the ability to create and customize any templates available to them on the site.
